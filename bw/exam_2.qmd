```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(rnaturalearth) 
library(sf)

tuesdata <- tt_load('2020-02-18')
fc <- tuesdata$food_consumption


head(fc)
```
```{r}
 fc |>
  mutate(food_category = fct_recode(food_category, 
         "Lamb" = "Lamb & Goat",
         "Dairy" = "Milk - inc. cheese",
         "Wheat" = "Wheat and Wheat Products", 
         "Nuts" = "Nuts inc. Peanut Butter"
                          )) 
```



1.  Which 5 countries consume the most food?

```{r}
fc |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(sum = sum(consumption)) |>
  arrange(desc(sum)) |>
  head(5)
```

```{r}
fc |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(sum = sum(consumption)) |>
  arrange(desc(sum)) |>
  head(5) |>
ggplot(aes(x = country, y = sum)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Country", y = "Food Consumption")
```
2. Which top 5 countries consume each food?

```{r}
fc |>
  select(food_category, country, consumption) |>
   group_by(food_category) |>
  slice_max(consumption, n = 5)
```


```{r}
fc |>
  select(food_category, country, consumption) |>
  group_by(food_category) |>
  slice_max(consumption, n = 5) |>
ggplot(aes(x = country, y = consumption)) +
geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~food_category) +
  labs(x = "Country", y = "Consumption")
```

3. What does the consumption of each food look like?

```{r}
fc |>
  left_join(fcc |> select(-co2_emission), group_by(food_category) |> join_by(name == country))
```
```{r}
ne_countries(returnclass == "sf") |>
  select(name, geometry) |>
  mutate(name = ifelse(name == "United States of America", "USA", name)) 
  
```
