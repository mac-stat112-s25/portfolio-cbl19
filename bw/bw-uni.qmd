title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Importing data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
#Graphing relationship between number of hikes and elevation of each
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "pink", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```
