title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
```


```{r}
#Births per year 1970-1985 per month as trivariable relationship
data("Birthdays")
daily_births <- Birthdays |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(births = sum(births)) |> 
  mutate(year = year(date), 
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         day_of_month = mday(date),
         day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE))

ggplot(daily_births, aes(y= births, color = month, x = year)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births", color = "Month")
