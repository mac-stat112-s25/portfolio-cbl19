title: "Quadvariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  
#Observing the temperature of 3 different locations at 9am, 3pm, and facet wrap seeing if it rained that day
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ raintoday) +
  labs(x = "Temp at 9am", y = "Temp at 3pm", color = "Location")
```
